# The DataTank

This is The DataTank Git repo.

The DataTank is a generic REST web-service. If you want to set up an API, you can take this code, add the needed modules and start building your web-service in no time.

We are doing this by creating an Application Programming Interface. This interface is implemented in PHP and can be reused by various of other projects.
